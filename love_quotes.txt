To love is to burn, to be on fire
True love stories never have endings
Never make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option
He is not a lover who does not love forever
Him that I love, I wish to be free – even from me
In the end we discover that to love and let go can be the same thing
Love must be as much a light as it is a flame
Love yourself. Then forget it. Then, love the world
Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up
I wish I had done everything on Earth with you
It is better to be hated for what you are than loved for what you are not
Each time you love, love as deeply as if it were forever – only, nothing is eternal
If I know what love is, it is because of you
A loving heart is the truest wisdom
Every thing that you love, you will eventually lose, but in the end, love will return in a different form
We must love one another or die
Build bridges, not walls
Unless you love someone, nothing else makes sense
Love is a great master. It teaches us to be what we never were
Love is the expansion of two natures in such fashion that each include the other, each is enriched by the other
